subtitle: Introduction to CJ Ricciardi
---

My name is CJ Ricciardi.  After fifteen years in the rat race I took some time for reflection, and realized I was not enjoying much about working other than the money.  So I've decided to start a career in data science so I can spend most of my time working on my passion rather than my bank account.

### When I"m not coding:

  * Jiu Jitsu Blue belt
  * Husband to the best wife ever, Emily Ortlieb
  * Iron Distance Triathlon finisher
